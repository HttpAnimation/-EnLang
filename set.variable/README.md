# set.variable

set.variable allows you to define and assign values to variables within your EKG code.

## Importing
To import set.variable, add the following to your EKG file:
```ekg
get set.variable
```

## Usage
To use set.variable, add the line:
```ekg
set.variable variable_name = value
```
Replace `variable_name` with the name of the variable you want to define, and `value` with the value you want to assign to the variable.

## Example
Here is an example of how to define and assign values to variables:
```ekg
get set.variable

set.variable greeting = Hello
set.variable name = John
```
After defining these variables, you can use them later in your EKG code.
