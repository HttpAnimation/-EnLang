# -EnLang
A scripting lanuge that is made to be easy to write and compiled with out errors.

## How it works
The backend of EnLang is based off [Python](https://www.python.org/) and when ever you run the script for your project it will convert that into a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script for a one time then run that script and remove it.

## Getting started
To get started with [EnLang](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/-EnLang) read [here](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/-EnLang/blob/main/Making%20a%20new%20project/README.md) to make your starting project.

## Documation
Remember even if a import has a [Python](https://www.python.org/) or other script with the same name does not mean it will work the same.
